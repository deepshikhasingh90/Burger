## Overview

This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a <Devour it!> button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page. The app is using a database for storing every burger, whether devoured or not.
